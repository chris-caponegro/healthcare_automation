Hi, can you tell me what brings you in today?  
Yeah, I’ve been having a really bad cough for the past week. It’s been getting worse.  
Have you had any fever or chills?  
Yeah, I had a fever two days ago, but it went away. I still feel really tired, though.  
Any shortness of breath or chest pain?  
Not really chest pain, but I do feel a little tightness when I breathe deeply.  
Are you taking any medications for it?  
Just some over-the-counter cough syrup. It helps a little.  
Any past medical conditions we should be aware of?  
I have asthma, but it’s usually under control.  
Okay, thanks for sharing. The doctor will be in shortly.
