 Hi, can you tell me what brings you in today? Yeah, I have I cough. I've been having a really bad cough for the past week and it's been getting worse. Have you had any fever, chills? Yeah, I had a fever two days ago, but a one-away, I still feel really tired, though. Any shortness of breath or chest pain? Not really chest pain, but I do feel a little tightness when I breathe deeply. Are you taking medications for it? Or some over-the-counter cough syrup? Helps a little bit. Any past medical conditions we should be aware of? I have asthma, but it's usually under control. Okay, thanks for sharing. The doctor will be with you shortly.
